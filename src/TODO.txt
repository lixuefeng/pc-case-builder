nice. now let's fix another issue: 1. after selection 2 or more parts, there should be a group button in the right sidebar.  
the behavior should be: 
0. if select 1 part, show name/type/id/transform/appearance/action buttons(copy/delete/hide/hide others we don't have this yet.)/connector buttons
1. if select 2 parts show item list (already there) and connection/subtract/group buttons/action buttons(delete/hide)
2. if select more than 2 parts, show item list,group button/group buttons/action buttons(delete/hide)
