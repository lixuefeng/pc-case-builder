0. introduce cut operation. interaction should be like:
  0.1 click cut button on the topbar
  0.2 define a face to cut. we can show a thin plane and let user to rotate it to define the face.
  0.3 selection one or more objects to cut
  0.4 click cut button to cut

1. half lap joint for long beams that don't fit 3d printer. we need to cut the beam into 2 parts and connect them with a half lap joint. 
  1.1 so first we need to reuse split operation
  1.2 then introduce half lap joint
  1.3 we already have screw functionality, we can reuse it
  1.4 we need to introduce nut (like hex nut)

2. Due to limited dimensional accuracy in 3D printing, parts designed with zero clearance will result in an interference fit and won’t assemble properly.
  2.1 this need to be fixed for mortise and tenon joint and cross joint 
  2.2 the clearance should be configurable default value is 0.1mm

3. we need to make parts on motherboard and graphics card can be configurable
    3.1 io cut out on motherboard: position and size should be configurable
    3.2 size the graphics card should be configurable
    3.3 io bracket on graphics card: position and size should be configurable

4. the shape of graphics bracket is still not correct

5. The transform axes must switch between Local and Global to allow correct movement after rotation

6. export to stl
    6.1 export the shape with holes correctly
    6.2 export grouped objects as one stl file
