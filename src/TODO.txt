1. half lap joint for long beams that don't fit 3d printer. we need to cut the beam into 2 parts and connect them with a half lap joint. 
  1.1 so first we need to introduce cut operation
  1.2 then introduce half lap joint
  1.3 we already have screw functionality, we can reuse it
  1.4 we need to introduce nut (like hex nut)

2. Due to limited dimensional accuracy in 3D printing, parts designed with zero clearance will result in an interference fit and won’t assemble properly.
  2.1 this need to be fixed for mortise and tenon joint and cross joint 
  2.2 the clearance should be configurable default value is 0.1mm

3. we need to make parts on motherboard and graphics card can be configurable
    3.1 io cut out on motherboard: position and size should be configurable
    3.2 size the graphics card should be configurable
    3.3 io bracket on graphics card: position and size should be configurable
